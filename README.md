# Vanillicon Proxy

This is a fork of the original vanillicon plugin for [vanilla forums](https://vanillaforums.org/). Likewise, it provides fun default user icons from [vanillicon.com](http://vanillicon.com). However, VanilliconProxy introduces two new features:

1. **Proxy:** Icons are downloaded indirectly through your server. This enhances privacy for your users, since third-parties are not able to track them anymore.
2. **Cache:** Requested icons are cached on your server and they are then provided to your users without access to third-party servers. This enhances availability of your forum.

Please feel free to create issues or pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/korelstar/vanilla-proxyvanillicon/). :-)
